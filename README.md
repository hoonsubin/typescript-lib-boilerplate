> A starter project that makes creating a TypeScript library extremely easy.

This is a boilerplate repository for creating libraries with TypeScript.
Everything in here originally belongs to <https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter.git> and all credit goes to everyone who contributed to that project.

## Usage

Clone this repository and run

```bash
yarn
```

inside the project directory.

**Start coding!** `package.json` and entry files are already set up for you, so don't worry about linking to your main file, typings, etc. Just keep those files with the same name.

## Features

- Zero-setup. After running `yarn install` things will setup for you :wink:
- **[RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/)** for multiple optimized bundles following the [standard convention](http://2ality.com/2017/04/setting-up-multi-platform-packages.html) and [Tree-shaking](https://alexjoverm.github.io/2017/03/06/Tree-shaking-with-Webpack-2-TypeScript-and-Babel/)
- Tests, coverage and interactive watch mode using **[Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/)**
- **[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)** and **[TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)** for code formatting and consistency
- **Docs automatic generation and deployment** to `gh-pages`, using **[TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/)**
- Automatic types `(*.d.ts)` file generation
- **[Travis](https://travis-ci.org)** integration and **[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)** report
- (Optional) **Automatic releases and changelog**, using [Semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), [Conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) and [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) (for the git hooks)

## Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```typescript
import myLib from 'mylib'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```typescript
import something from 'mylib/dist/lib/something'
```

## yarn scripts

- `yarn test`: Run test suite
- `yarn start`: Run `yarn build` in watch mode
- `yarn run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
- `yarn run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
- `yarn run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
- `yarn run lint`: Lints code
- `yarn run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)

## Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.

## Automatic releases

_**Prerequisites**: you need to create/login accounts and add your project to:_

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
- [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)

_**Prerequisite for Windows**: Semantic-release uses
**[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)** so you will need to
install
[Microsoft's windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)
using this command:_

```bash
yarn install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

### Setup steps

Follow the console instructions to install semantic release and run it (answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?").

_Note: make sure you've setup `repository.url` in your `package.json` file_

```bash
yarn install -g semantic-release-cli
semantic-release-cli setup
# IMPORTANT!! Answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?" question. It is already prepared for you :P
```

From now on, you'll need to use `yarn commit`, which is a convenient way to create conventional commits.

Automatic releases are possible thanks to [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), which publishes your code automatically on [github](https://github.com/) and [yarn](https://www.yarnjs.com/), plus generates automatically a changelog. This setup is highly influenced by [Kent C. Dodds course on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)

## Git Hooks

There is already set a `precommit` hook for formatting your code with Prettier :nail_care:

By default, there are two disabled git hooks. They're set up when you run the `yarn run semantic-release-prepare` script. They make sure:

- You follow a [conventional commit message](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
- Your build is not going to fail in [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) (or your CI server), since it's runned locally before `git push`

This makes more sense in combination with [automatic releases](#automatic-releases)

## FAQ

### `Array.prototype.from`, `Promise`, `Map`... is undefined

TypeScript or Babel only provides down-emits on syntactical features (`class`, `let`, `async/await`...), but not on functional features (`Array.prototype.find`, `Set`, `Promise`...), . For that, you need Polyfills, such as [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [`babel-polyfill`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) (which extends `core-js`).

For a library, `core-js` plays very nicely, since you can import just the polyfills you need:

```typescript
import "core-js/fn/array/find"
import "core-js/fn/string/includes"
import "core-js/fn/promise"
...
```

### What `yarn install` does on first run

It runs the script `tools/init` which sets up everything for you. In short, it:

- Configures RollupJS for the build, which creates the bundles
- Configures `package.json` (typings file, main file, etc)
- Renames main src and test files

### Iif I don't want git-hooks, automatic releases or semantic-release

Then you may want to:

- Remove `commitmsg`, `postinstall` scripts from `package.json`. That will not use those git hooks to make sure you make a conventional commit
- Remove `yarn run semantic-release` from `.travis.yml`

### What if I don't want to use coveralls or report my coverage?

Remove `yarn run report-coverage` from `.travis.yml`
